# Machine-Learning-Analysis-of-Stock-Price-Trends
This project analyses historical stock price data from five companies (AMZN, FB, GOOGL, IBM, and MSFT) to predict stock price trends using machine learning techniques. Conducted as part of my MSc AI studies, the analysis employs three distinct approaches:
- Regression: Predicts future closing prices through rigorous data preprocessing, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.
- Classification: Frames the problem as predicting stock price movement (up, down, or stable) using classification models, supported by comprehensive experimentation and analysis.
- Clustering: Utilises clustering techniques to group stock data and predict future prices based on cluster means, involving detailed preprocessing, feature engineering, and result interpretation.
The project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to financial data, showcasing their potential for stock price analysis and trend prediction.
